 * undefined and null

 * otherwise described in the program, it will
 * be represented by undefined when called upon.
 * If a value is set, but empty, and has no other
 * appropriate type to describe this, it will
 * instead show as null. Null is often set by hand
 * by programmers in JavaScript to show that it is
 * empty with intention, likely to be filled in later,
 * or was previously filled and has now been cleared.
 * Note, that for legacy reasons, the typeof output
 * for null is "object", so old code can expect the
 * old output without error or running incorrectly.

  *  1) Iterator starts at zero...
  *  2) At each step, make sure that iterator is smaller than the # of items in the array.
  *  3) Bump the iterator up by one, so we can check the next item in the array.
  *
  * You can also research "Array().forEach()" and "for...of" loops.

 /**
  * Objects
  * *******
  * An object is usually used to represent a real-world entity. Something
  * that might require a few pieces of information to represent, and means
  * something to people or a business that serves them.
  * Pieces of information are considered properties of an object. They can
  * be of any valid JavaScript data-type, including objects and arrays.
  * Careful not to add too many layers and complexity to your objects!
  * Properties can be accessed via the object's name followed by a period
  * and the property nameâ€”this is "dot-syntax." Alternatively (though less
  * commonly) you can use the object's name followed by a string
  * representation of the property name (in quotes) enclosed in square
  * brackets.
  *             Dot syntax: myObject.propertyName
  *  Square bracket syntax: myObject['propertyName']
  * 
  * Because objects are not "indexed" like arrays, this format of storage
  * is often referred to as an associative array, map, dictionary, or hash
  * in other languages. These are key-value pairs, and are a very common
  * mechanism in programming.
  * 
  * In JavaScript, functions can be stored in objects. A function inside
  * an object is usually referred to as a "method."
  * Methods are powerful, as they can reference the object's very own
  * properties, allowing an object to manipulate itself when its methods
  * are executed.

  * Symbols
  * *******
  * This data-type will not always come up, but it is present in many
  * languages and can come in handy.
  * If there is worry that an object's property name may be used multiple
  * times, but there is need for these properties to hold unique values,
  * a unique identifier is needed. For cases like this, symbols act as
  * perfect unique identifiers!
  * Even if two symbols have the same "name", they will not match when
  * compared, it must be the exact same symbol.
