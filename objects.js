/**
 * Objects
 * *******
 * An object is usually used to represent a real-world entity. Something
 * that might require a few pieces of information to represent, and means
 * something to people or a business that serves them.
 * Pieces of information are considered properties of an object. They can
 * be of any valid JavaScript data-type, including objects and arrays.
 * Careful not to add too many layers and complexity to your objects!
 * Properties can be accessed via the object's name followed by a period
 * and the property nameâ€”this is "dot-syntax." Alternatively (though less
 * commonly) you can use the object's name followed by a string
 * representation of the property name (in quotes) enclosed in square
 * brackets.
 *             Dot syntax: myObject.propertyName
 *  Square bracket syntax: myObject['propertyName']
 * 
 * Because objects are not "indexed" like arrays, this format of storage
 * is often referred to as an associative array, map, dictionary, or hash
 * in other languages. These are key-value pairs, and are a very common
 * mechanism in programming.
 * 
 * In JavaScript, functions can be stored in objects. A function inside
 * an object is usually referred to as a "method."
 * Methods are powerful, as they can reference the object's very own
 * properties, allowing an object to manipulate itself when its methods
 * are executed.
